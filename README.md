# Docker Homelab Stack

## Overview

Self-hosted Docker homelab stack for media, monitoring, and personal services.
Designed to be reproducible via docker-compose and accessible through a reverse proxy.

TrueNAS and Portainer are not included here, as they are not deployed via docker-compose.

Remote access is granted either through Tailscale, or a Cloudflare tunnel, which requires a whitelisted Google OAuth login.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

This repo assumes you have a TrueNAS installation with 2 pools:

- NAS - The main HDD based, bulk storage pool.
- Apps - The SSD based, application pool.

You will also need a public domain which Cloudflare has access to/manages if you want a remote tunnel without a VPN/Tailscale.

### Setup

1. In TrueNAS, deploy a Portainer instance from the built-in ix-apps.
2. In Portainer, deploy the stacks located in `/stacks`. These should be connected to a Git repo for easier updates.
3. Restore the config directories from backup.
4. Restart the stacks.

## Secrets

Most environment variables are committed in stack files.

The following secrets must be injected via Portainer at deployment time:

Network stack:

- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`
- `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`

Applications stack:

- `WUD_LSCR_USERNAME` - GitHub username
- `WUD_LSCR_TOKEN` - GitHub API token
- `ZEROBYTE_SECRET`
